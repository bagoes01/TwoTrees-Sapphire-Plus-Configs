- ## Support me
- I really want to dive deeper in the Marlin Firmware story on the MKS Nano Boards. But i cant flash my Board in my Printer all the time. I need a spare Board with Display for the development. If u have a spare coin, send it via PayPay at https://paypal.me/TheoRadical?country.x=DE&locale.x=de_DE
- Thank You!

- Visit the site, choose at "Board series" "MKS Robin series" -- at "Board Type" "MKS Robin Nano V1.x-TFT35" -- at "Firmware Type" choose "MKS Robin Nano Firmware 2.0.x"
- (optional) At the next step you can add a new Bootscreen to your Printer, just click on the pictures.
- To load the right settings for our Sapphire Plus (Version V3, look at WTF?!) you go to "Configuration File" next to "Display UI" and "Export"
- Click at "Import file" and choose the **robin_nano35_cfg.txt**
- All necessary setting for the Sapphire Plus will be loaded and can be changed after your gusto. Like E-Steps an so on. 
- **If you dont change any settings you get a pure, stock firmware for your printer**
- Just click at "Export" and set all Options. Unzip the Files, copy it on a SD-Card, put it in the printer and "Engage!"
- Power on the printer and wait for install. 
- Have fun and happy printing!
- ## Support me
- I really want to dive deeper in the Marlin Firmware story on the MKS Nano Boards. But i cant flash my Board in my Printer all the time. I need a spare Board with Display for the development. If u have a spare coin, send it via PayPay at https://paypal.me/TheoRadical?country.x=DE&locale.x=de_DE
- Thank You!
